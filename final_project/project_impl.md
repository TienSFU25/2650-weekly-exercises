## Project Implementation

The final implementation of the project is due on the last day of classes, Friday August 2 2024. Because of the diverse possibilities for the project content, it is difficult to specify “how much” should be implemented. Roughly speaking, it should be enough to justify the corresponding marks for `n` students in their last term at Langara.

The final product should be a reasonably polished, usable web system. It is expected that the system will do a good job of solving the problem it is designed to tackle.

## Submission

Create a Git tag for your submission. Something like this:

`git tag final`

`git push origin --tags`

The final implementation submission will include:

1. A Git tag for your project's code (+SHA + screenshot as always). I expect to be able to `docker-compose up` or some other similar one-liner to get stuff running.

2. A `README.md` file with notes about your system, including:

- The exact command to bring it up from a just-checked-out repository.
- Any comments you want to make about the project: what's working, what isn't. Also note any features that you think might be easily missed while marking.
- Any userids and passwords that are needed to fully explore the system. Seeding your system with some basic test data is also helpful.
- The URL (possibly http://localhost:8080/) where we can access your project after bringing up the VM.
