Your proposal is due on June 21, 2024 (the week after the first midterm). You may submit it earlier if you would like feedback so you can begin implementation.

The proposal should be approximately one page in length. It should describe your plans for the project, what will be implemented, and the technologies that will be used in the implementation (you are certainly free to change technologies later). Your proposal can (and perhaps should) be more ambitious than your final implementation. Please read [project_topic_notes](./project_topic_notes.md) before submitting your proposal.

As proposals are submitted, they will be reviewed and posted for others to see.
