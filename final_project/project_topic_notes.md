## Project Topics

Selecting a project topic for a web development course can be both exciting and challenging. As last-semester students, your project should not only showcase your technical skills but also engage and inspire your team. Here's some guidelines

1. It has to do more than CRUD

2. Use at least one interesting, technically challenging framework/library that's not taught in this course. Example: WebGL, D3.js, Chart.js

3. It should try to incorporate course topics

**Use ChatGPT for ideas**.

You could also do a significant enhancement to an open-source library. Make sure you define what your work is/isn't.

Send Tien your proposal as soon as you want, I'll give my feedback within a couple days so your group can start on the project asap.
