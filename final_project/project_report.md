## Project Overview

A project overview must be completed **individually** by each group member. In this, you should give an overview of the design and implementation of the project. Also, give a broad indication of what parts of the project were completed by which group members. You can also give a summary of future work that could be done on your project.

I don't have a length requirement here, if you can explain your system with two sentences, you are free to do so. In general, I expect you to use whatever tools necessary to convey your ideas across. Which in practice usually means less text, more diagrams, more ELI5s.

This is due on the same day the implementation is due, August 2, 2024.
