## Project Overview

A project overview must be completed **individually** by each group member. In this, you should give an overview of the design and implementation of the project. Please include items similar to how we structure our "system design" questions

- A diagram of the database schema (you can use DBML). Include a SQL vs NoSQL discussion if relevant
- Architecture of your entire web stack (frontend, web server, DB, maybe a cache, external APIs, whatever microservice...)
- A discussion of how you've attempted to mitigate security concerns around your application, and potential loopholes.

Also, give a broad indication of what parts of the project were completed by which group members. You can also give a summary of future work that could be done on your project.

I don't have a length requirement here, if you can explain your system with two sentences, you are free to do so. In general, I expect you to use whatever tools necessary to convey your ideas across. Which in practice usually means less text, more diagrams, more ELI5s.

This is due on the same day the implementation is due, August 2, 2024.
