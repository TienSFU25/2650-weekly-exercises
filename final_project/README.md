## Project

Your final project for this course will be the planning and implementation of a web information system. The project will be evaluated with respect to the overall idea, implemented functionality, polish, and technical quality. See also [ProjectTopicNotes](project_topic_notes.md).

As proposals are submitted, project topics will be posted.

### Deliverables

The technology evaluation is completed in the project groups (except the overviews and weighting).

1. [Group formation], Saturday June 15
2. [Proposal](project_proposal.md), Saturday June 22, 2.5%

3. [Checkpoint Implementation](project_checkpoint.md), Saturday July 13, 2.5%

4. [Final Implementation](project_impl.md), Friday August 2, 25%

5. [Project Report](project_report.md), Friday August 2, 5% (individual marks)

### Technology Choices

You must use a full-stack web framework as the basis for your implementation. Some examples: Rails, Django, Express/React.

You must use only software that can be (legally) downloaded, installed and used for free.

You must use a Git repository on Github for your code. All group members must use the repository to commit their own contributions. Collaboration on code (pair programming or similar) should be noted in the commit messages.

### Notes

You are expected to take the topics discussed in lectures into account when implementing your project.

It is expected that all group members will complete an approximately equal share of the project, including the implementation. See [ProjectWeighting](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2021fa-cmpt-470-d1/pages/ProjectWeighting) for more information on expectations.

All submitted materials must be your own work. Any material copied from another source must be clearly referenced. This applies to writing, images, source code, and anything else submitted.
