## Project Checkpoint

To make sure you're on the right track and will be ready for your demonstration, you will be required to submit a partial implementation by **Saturday July 12, 2024**. By this time, enough of your project should be working that you could do a small demonstration of your project and give us an idea of what will be done. **Essentially I want to see some working code at this point**

Your code must be in your group's Github repository. I will look for a reasonable spaced out commit history, not a one-time Big Bang import.

Create a Git tag for your submission something like this:

`git tag checkpoint`

`git push origin --tags`

## Submission

For the checkpoint, you need to submit:

1. A Git tag + repo link for your project's code. As usual, take the screenshot of the commit history screen.

2. `readme.txt` with any notes you think are relevant to evaluating the code (to give us the best chance to see what you have working). This shouldn't be very long: a few paragraphs or points.

TODO: Tien will make a submission link available on Brightspace
