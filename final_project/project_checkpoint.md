## Project Checkpoint

To make sure you're on the right track and will be ready for your demonstration, you will be required to submit a partial implementation by **Saturday July 13, 2024**. By this time, enough of your project should be working that you could do a small demonstration of your project and give us an idea of what will be done. **Essentially I want to see some working code at this point**

**I also require a Figma wireframe**. You can find Figma tutorials here

MIT Weblab's Figma content is also pretty good. Like their content if you find it helpful, many thanks for MIT for allowing us to use their stuff!

## Submission

Your code must be in your group's Github repository

Create a Git tag for your submission something like this:

`git tag checkpoint`

`git push origin --tags`

For the checkpoint, you need to submit on Brightspace:

1. A Git tag link (+SHA + screenshot) for your project's code. As usual, take the screenshot of the commit history screen.

2. `readme.txt` with any notes you think are relevant to evaluating the code (to give us the best chance to see what you have working). This shouldn't be very long: a few paragraphs or points.

3. Figma share link. Tien must be able to view your Figma
