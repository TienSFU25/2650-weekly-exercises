Modify the CSS file using Flexbox so that you get these results. Note: these questions are not cumulative, you are expected to "start over" after each one

1. Notice that the text items are also centered "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3"

### Q2: Basic CSS techniques [2 points each]

Credits to Greg Baker: https://coursys.sfu.ca/2021fa-cmpt-470-d1/pages/Exercise2

#### Style 1

Save the HTML file `exer2-menu.html`. The page has a heading, menu, and some contents. You may not change the HTML for these questions (except maybe the stylesheet link).
Create a stylesheet `style1.css` that makes the page look more-or-less like this:

![image](https://github.com/TienSFU25/2650-weekly-exercises/assets/10173141/56d1728c-0b2f-49ba-b9a3-3e26a664b511)

The exact display of the page will change depending on the window/font size. It should change in a reasonable way.
Hints: The line breaks and widths will change with the window size and that's okay; the display property for the menu list items; colours I used were #228 and #bbb; no need to try to match the fonts or spacing exactly.

Could you do this with `display: flex`?

#### Style 2

Create a second stylesheet `style2.css` that makes the page look more-or-less like this.

Again, the display should adapt to different window sizes in a reasonable way.
Hints: colours I used were #64a and #66c.

### Q3: SVG and animations [5 points]

In SVG, figure out a way to write out your name using path. You can write in print or recursive. [2]

Figure out a way to animate it using keyframes. It could be the most basic translate or rotation, or you can get as creative as you'd like [3]

### Submission

For Q1, submit three CSS files using `flex1.css` as a template, for each question

For Q2, submit `style1.css`, `style2.css`

For Q3, submit a new HTML and CSS file for your animated SVG
