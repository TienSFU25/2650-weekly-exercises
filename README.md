This repo contains weekly exercises for CPSC 2650 - Summer 2024

## Term projects

We will have one large "assignment" in the form of a technology evaluation. The purpose of the tech eval is to get you some exposure outside the MERN stack

[Tech eval](tech_eval/README.md)

And of course, the final project where you get to demonstrate what you've learned.
