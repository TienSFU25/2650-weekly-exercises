## Week 4 exercises

2 parts here

1. [NodeJS](./node_exercise.md)
2. [MongoDB](./mongo_exercise.md)

### Submission

1. A Github repo link (+ SHA + screenshot) of the Node exercise

2. `mongo_test.js`

3. `mongoose_test.js`

Do NOT submit your `.env` file with the `MONGOURI` that has your Mongo password. You can assume that we will mark your Mongo script with our own Mongo credentials. If you submit your Mongo credentials, we will apply a -20% penalty.

Feel free to put the Mongo stuff in the root directory of the Node repo. Make it clear to us where the Mongoose stuff is

### Grading

I got tired of coming up with arbitrary numbers for grading each section, so let's use Jordan Miller's universal rubric. The Node vs Mongo parts will be graded separately, for a total grade out of 6

- 3/3: "nice!"
  - Exceptional work with all tasks completed satisfactorily according to the specification
  - Efficient, well-designed, and well-coded
- 2/3: "satisfactory"
  - Most tasks completed, but a few key things missing
  - Some inefficiencies in the implementation, or deviation from the specification
- 1/3: "it barely works"
  - Some progress made, but major deficiencies in solution
  - Many tasks missed or major deviation from specification
- 0/3: "you didn't do much"
  - Little or no progress
  - Few points from specification implemented

Note that up to -0.5 may be deducted for improper hand in, disorganized files or code, etc. Please ask me if in doubt.
