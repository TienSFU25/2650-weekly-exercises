## Demonstration Web Site

Construct a web site that illustrates the technology you have chosen in an application of your choice.

Your demonstration web site can be used to support your presentation and written evaluation.

## Deploying

We haven't gotten to the AWS/deployment lectures of the course yet, however you're still highly encouraged to figure out how to deploy your site to somewhere publicly accessible (an EC2 instance, or somebody's computer). If not, clearly write in `README.md` the **one** command that we can run to build the source code, and get the website up and running.

## Submitting

1. A Git SHA + screenshot for the source code for your site. Follow the convention in [github_submission](../github_submission.mdgithub_submission.md)

2. The URL where we can find your demo site. If not submitted, we will assume there is a `README.md` with a one-liner that we can run to get the site up, e.g `docker compose up`.

3. [optional] A plain text file about.txt containing any usernames/passwords we need to fully explore the system, as well as any comments you want to make about how the pages were created and what we should look for.
