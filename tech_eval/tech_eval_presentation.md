## Tech Eval Presentation

You will be responsible for a presentation that demonstrates the technology you have chosen. The presentation should be no longer than 15 minutes. Err on the side of shorter, not longer!

The presentation should give overview of the tool to a technical audience (the class). We're all engineers here, so it's reasonable to show code and technical features.

Try to give the class good tools by which to evaluate your technology for use in a project (not necessarily the course project). You should focus on questions like (but not limited to)

1. Why is X useful?

2. What kinds of problems does X solve well?

3. What kinds of problems does X **not** solve well?

4. What makes X cool? Does X have surprising features?

Note that explaining the highlights of a technology in a reasonable way in a short time like this is not easy. It requires a fairly deep understanding of the technology, and certainly more than reading the “about” page on their web site.
