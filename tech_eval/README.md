## Technology evaluation

Our tech eval will be a lighter version of Greg Baker's setup [here](https://coursys.sfu.ca/2021fa-cmpt-470-d1/pages/TechEval)

Each project group is responsible for demonstrating and evaluating a particular web technology. You should focus on the overall aspects of the tool, as opposed to lists of features.

Groups must propose a list of possible topics by Thursday **June 15, 2024**. See [topic_notes](topic_notes.md) for more information on choosing topics, and [tech_eval_topics](tech_eval_topics.md) for topics for each group.

### Deliverables

The technology evaluation is completed in the project groups. It is expected that all group members will complete an approximately equal share of the technology evaluation.

[Demonstration Web Site](tech_eval_website.md), 4%

[Written Comparison](tech_eval_written.md), 4%

[Presentation](tech_eval_presentation), 2%

### Order

The groups will present in a randomly generated order (TBD I will run an RNG script when groups are finalized)
