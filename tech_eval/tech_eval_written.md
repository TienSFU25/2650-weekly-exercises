Write an evaluation summarizing the technology you have chosen and compare it with at least `n` comparable technology alternatives suitable for similar applications (where `n` is your group size). This evaluation should be roughly `200n` words in length.

The definition of “similar applications” depends on your chosen technology, and could be interpreted quite broadly if necessary.

You should focus on the overall aspects of the tool, as opposed to lists of features.

Overall, we're looking for is:

1. Did the group sufficiently summarize what features/benefits the tool provides?

2. Did the group choose an appropriate set of comparable technologies?

3. Did the comparisons with other technologies do a good job contrasting the technologies? (a good way to do this would be through pros and cons)
