## Tech Eval Topic Notes

In order to ensure good breadth in the topics covered, different groups will not be allowed to cover conflicting topics (“Conflict” will be determined by Tien). Groups presenting first will get priority. That is, if you present first, you can talk about whatever you want. If you present second, you can talk about anything except what the first group does.

Submit a text file to Tech Eval Topic Choices on Brightspace with your choices of topics (in order of preference).

Please be sure to send several choices of topic. If your first choice isn't available, I will look at the next, and so on. If none of the topics on your list are available, you'll go into the first-come, first-served category.
