## AWS

### Financial disclaimer

Please be advised that students are solely responsible for managing and monitoring their AWS (Amazon Web Services) billing and usage. This includes setting up appropriate alerts and notifications to track service usage and associated costs.

The instructor will not be held liable for any charges incurred by students for their use of AWS services. It is the responsibility of each student to ensure that they understand the billing practices of AWS and to manage their account settings accordingly to prevent unexpected charges.

For guidance on setting up billing alerts and monitoring usage, students can refer to the following AWS resources:

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/billing-what-is.html
https://aws.amazon.com/free/

NOTE: I will guide you through how to setup Billing alerts. As long as you've setup these alerts properly, use only "Free tier" stuff, and **delete all AWS resources when we're done grading them**, you should be totally fine.

### The actual exercise
