## AWS and Docker

There will be 2 parts to this exercise. I suggest doing the AWS stuff first, as most likely folks will get stuck there, and I could help people in-person. The Docker part is more of a lab that's meant to help you with the AWS part

- [AWS](aws-exercise.md)

### Submission

Reposting of the submission requirements inside the AWS Exercise file.

1. Screenshot of your IAM Identity Users page, showing that you've setup an IAM Account with the appropriate Permissions

2. Link to your EC2 instance's public IPv4 address. Going to `your_ipv4_address:3000` should show us your "website" running on EC2

3. Git repo of how you've Dockerized the `2650-docker-ec2` app (I imagine the Docker commits on top of the existing commits)

Jamie will grade this within the week, then be sure to turn off your EC2 instances (and whatever else you have on AWS) so you don't get billed.

### Grading

Usual 3 point scale
