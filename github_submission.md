When submitting links to Github repos, we will use the following convention

1. the Github repo link + branch name. You could use a [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) in place of a tag as well.

Example: https://github.com/TienSFU25/2650-weekly-exercises/tree/te-fp

2. the commit SHA
   Example: 641989540960f3fade07e346940a5aa330cd43dd

3. A screenshot of commits on your branch/tag that clearly shows the time of the SHA

## Example

https://github.com/TienSFU25/2650-weekly-exercises/commits/master/

Commit 641989540960f3fade07e346940a5aa330cd43dd
